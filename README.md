# Problems To Solve  
> Module: Theory of Algorithms  
> Lecturer: Dr. Ian McLoughlin  

This repositry will consists of a number of problems that will have to be completed for this module. It will be added to as the semester goes along and we get more problems to solve as part of the C.A. section of this module.  

## Problem 1 - Racket Programming  
We are requried to write, from scratch, a function that uses a brute-force algoritm that takes a single positive integer and return true if the number is a prime and flase if otherwise. The function is to be called "decide-prime".
